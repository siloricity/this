            <p>I have three friends. Three of which, have their own web site;<br />
            I want one too</p>
            <p>I learned HTML and CSS in like 3 days to make this web site so I hope it's like good or something idk.</p>
            <p>Back in like 8/9th grade I tried learning HTML.<br />
            <em>(Not part of a class, I just wanted to)</em><br />
            Although I didn't get much farther than changing the font color, It did
            serve as a first for reading code tutorials.<br />
            I used w3 back then and I still do now, it is very helpful
            introduction.</p>
            <p>BTW: That statement about having only three friends was an
            exaggeration. <em>(Or was it? idk hhhh)</em></p>
