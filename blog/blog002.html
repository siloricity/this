            <p>What is the Secret? Why don't you find out, source peeker</p>
            <p>Cheryl lied about her Secret. I want to make sure that I don't suffer the same.</p>
            <p>if you Really want to know the Secret..
            well i'll just tell you what the goal with all this is.<br>
            My goal with the Mystery is that I want to include the same Secret in everything that I create.
            Maybe as some sort of exercise for user input and audio playback
            (cough cough. what? cough.)</p>
            <p>It has been a giant headache trying to get the Secret to work on every page.
            I managed to figure out a way, but I'm still not very satisfied.
            HTML is really not designed for scale without external automation tools in mind,
            such as static site generator.
            I choose not to use one and I am suffering the consequences of my actions.</p>
            <h5 class="blogsub">JavaScript Script™</h5>
            <div class="blogline"></div>
            <p>
            So, I have this JavaScript Script™ that starts my Secret  
            <img src="../assets/blog/blog002-1.png" alt="mystery.js contents"></img><br>
            The Plan: connect this script to every HTML page.<br>
            The Problem: the path to my Mysterious Wav File is based on the HTML file, not the JavaScript Script™.<br>
            This means that if I have it connected into a subfolder, it won't be able to find my Mysterious Wav File.<br>
            The first idea was to just copy the Mysterious Wav File into every subfolder, which is obviously ridiculous.
            So I didn't end up doing that.</p>
            <p>
            The solution I came up with was to have a copy of my JavaScript Script™ that
            adds "../" to the beginning of the path for pages that are one folder deep.
            It's still not pretty, but you know what they(me) say, If it werks it twerks.
