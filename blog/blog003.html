            <p>Rn, my favorite font is Exo. U can probably tell since
            almost everything I create uses that font, including the text
            box you're reading right now.<br>
            I found it through its use in Arcaea - New Dimension Rhythm Game.
            While testing out visuals I chose that font as the first thing I could think of,
            and now it's part of my visual identity, my design language.<br>
            My previous favorite font (that I still like a lot) is Century Gothic.
            It is the font used in my logo down there in the corner.<br>
            <p>
            That logo was created wayyy back in the day. I managed to find
            <em>The Ancient Message™</em> where it originated,
            in a Discord server I'm no longer part of.
            (I used my Mysterious Alt Account to take this screenshot recently)</p>

            image of my logo, 'i decided to use my favorite font to use', Deleted User,
            'Cool', siloricity, 'thx' "/>
            <p>(it was a mostly gd server back then)</p>
            <p>Now to get to the point of the blog's title.<br>
            I made that logo using paint.net<br>
            Yeah.</p>
            <p>I genuinely have no clue how I made something
            look like that with just text and brushes, but I did.<br>
            The worst part is, it's only 500 pixels and I never saved the logo with
            transparency. (Or maybe I did, I lost most of my data in 2022)<br>
            So it was permanently on that shade of gray.</p>
            <img src="../assets/blog/blog003-2.png" width="80%" alt="and that's why i recreated it as a vector!">
            <p>Most if not all art that I create nowadays is made with Inkscape.
            I enjoy the process of combining shapes together with outlines and gradients,
            the non-destructive editing process.
            Apparently GIMP has non-destructive editing now? But that shit jank af.</p>
            <p>Anyway.. so like<br>
            Other software that I use. I know I just roasted GIMP but I do use it a lot
            as a sort of general image manipulation program.<br>
            Most videos on my You Tube Channel are edited using Shotcut Video Editor.
            It's.. not good lmao. The size & rotate filter is terribly optimized and
            in general the software is very slow, but I like it.
            I like how precise I can edit my clips and the level of detail on the
            export menu is really nice.<br>
            Most alternate video editors that I try out are either super monetized,
            doesn't have features that I'm looking for,<br>
            or is just way too complex for me to be bothered learning how to use.</p>
